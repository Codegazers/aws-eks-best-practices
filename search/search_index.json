The guidance herein is part of a series of best practices guides that AWS is publishing to help customers implement EKS in accordance with best practices. Guides for Performance, Operational Excellence, Cost Optimization, and Reliability will be available in the coming months. How to use this guide \u00b6 This guide is meant for security practitioner who are responsible for implementing and monitoring the effectiveness of security controls for EKS clusters and the workloads they support. The guide is organized into different topic areas for easier consumption. Each topic starts with a brief overview, followed by a list of recommendations and best practices for securing your EKS clusters. The topics do not need to read in a particular order. Understanding the Shared Responsibility Model \u00b6 Security and compliance are considered shared responsibilities when using a managed service like EKS. Generally speaking, AWS is responisble for security \"of\" the cloud whereas you, the customer, are responsible for security \"in\" the cloud. With EKS, AWS is responsible for managing of the EKS managed Kubernetes control plane. This includes the Kubernetes masters, the ETCD database, and other infrastructure necessary for AWS to deliver a secure and reliable service. As a consumer of EKS, you are largely responsible for the topics in this guide, e.g. IAM, pod security, runtime security, network security, and so forth. When it comes to infrastructure security, AWS will assume additional responsibilities as you move from self-managed workers, to managed node groups, to Fargate. For example, with Fargate, AWS becomes responsible for securing the underlying instance/runtime used to run your Pods. AWS will also assume responsibility for securing and maintaining the underlying instance when you use Managed Node Groups (MNG). However, unlike Fargate, MNGs will not automatically scale your infrastructure/cluster. That can be handled by the cluster-autoscaler or other technologies such as native AWS autoscaling, SpotInst's Ocean , or Atlassian's Escalator . Before designing your system, it is important to know where the line of demarcation is between your responsibilities and the provider of the service (AWS). For additional information about the shared responsibility model, see https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/ Introduction \u00b6 There are several security best practice areas that are pertinent when using a managed Kubernetes service like EKS: Identity and Access Management Pod Security Runtime Security Network Security Multi-tenancy Detective Controls Infrastructure Security Data Encryption and Secrets Management Regulatory Compliance Incident Response As part of designing any system, you need to think about its security implications and the practices that can affect your security posture. For example, you need to control who can perform actions against a set of resources. You also need the ability to quickly identify security incidents, protect your systems and services from unauthorized access, and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data through data protection. Having a well-defined and rehearsed set of process for responding to security incidents will improve your security posture too. These tools and techniques are important because they support objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with regulatory obligations. AWS helps organizations achieve their security and compliance goals by offering a rich set of security services that have evolved based on feedback from a broad set of security conscious customers. By offering a highly secure foundation, customers can spend less time on \u201cundifferentiated heavy lifting\u201d and more time on achieving their business objectives. Feedback \u00b6 This guide is being released on GitHub so as to collect direct feedback and suggestions from the broader EKS/Kubernetes community. If you have a best practice that you feel we ought to include in the guide, please file an issue or submit a PR in the GitHub repository. Our intention is to update the guide periodically as new features are added to the service or when a new best practice evolves.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#security-best-practices-guide-for-the-elastic-kubernetes-service-eks","text":"This guide provides advice about protecting information, systems, and assets that are reliant on EKS while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

All 3 offer encryption at rest using a service managed key or a customer master key (CMK). For EBS you can use the in-tree storage driver or the EBS CSI driver . Both include parameters for encrypting volumes and supplying a CMK. For EFS, you can use the EFS CSI driver , however, unlike EBS, the EFS CSI driver does not support dynamic provisioning. If you want to use EFS with EKS, you will need to provision and configure at-rest encryption for the file system prior to creating a PV. For further information about EFS file encryption, please refer to Encrypting Data at Rest . Besides offering at-rest encryption, EFS and FSx for Lustre include an option for encrypting data in transit. FSx for Luster does this by default. For EFS, you can add transport encryption by adding the tls parameter to mountOptions in your PV as in this example: apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata: name: efs-pv spec: capacity: storage: 5Gi volumeMode: Filesystem accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain storageClassName: efs-sc mountOptions: - tls csi: driver: efs.csi.aws.com volumeHandle: <file_system_id> The FSx CSI driver supports dynamic provisioning of Lustre file systems. It encrypts data with a service managed key by default, although there is an option to provide you own CMK as in this example: kind: StorageClass apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: fsx-sc provisioner: fsx.csi.aws.com parameters: subnetId: subnet-056da83524edbe641 securityGroupIds: sg-086f61ea73388fb6b deploymentType: PERSISTENT_1 kmsKeyId: <kms_arn> Recommendations \u00b6 Encrypt data at rest \u00b6 Encrypting data at rest is considered a best practice. If you're unsure whether encryption is necessary, encrypt your data. Rotate your CMKs periodically \u00b6 Configure KMS to automatically rotate you CMKs. This will rotate your keys once a year while saving old keys indefinitely so that your data can still be decrypted. For additional information see Rotating customer master keys Use EFS access points to simplify access to shared datasets \u00b6 If you have shared datasets with different POSIX file permissions or want to restrict access to part of the shared file system by creating different mount points, consider using EFS access points. To learn more about working with access points, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-access-points.html. Today, if you want to use access point (AP) you'll need to reference the AP in the PV's volumeHandle parameter. Secrets management \u00b6 Kubernetes secrets are used to store sensitive information, such as user certificates, passwords, or API keys. They are persisted in etcd as base64 encoded strings. On EKS, the EBS volumes for etcd nodes are encypted with EBS encryption . A pod can retrieve a Kubernetes secrets objects by referencing the secret in the podSpec . These secrets can either be mapped to an environment variable or mounted as volume. For additional information on creating secrets, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/. Caution Secrets in a particular namespace can be referenced by all pods in the secret's namespace. Caution The node authorizer allows the Kubelet to read all of the secrets mounted to the node. Recommendations \u00b6 Use AWS KMS for envelop encryption of Kubernetes secrets \u00b6 This allows you to encrypt your secrets with a unique data encryption key (DEK). The DEK is then encypted using a key encryption key (KEK) from AWS KMS which can be automatically rotated on a recurring schedule. With the KMS plugin for Kubernetes, all Kubernetes secrets are stored in etcd in ciphertext instead of plain text and can only be decrypted by the Kubernetes API server. For additional details, see using EKS encryption provider support for defense in depth Audit the use of secrets \u00b6 On EKS, turn on audit logging and create a CloudWatch metrics filter and alarm to alert you when a secret is used (optional). The following is an example of a metrics filter for the Kubernetes audit log, {($.verb=\"get\") && ($.objectRef.resource=\"secret\")} . You can also use the following queries with CloudWatch Log Insights: fields @timestamp, @message | sort @timestamp desc | limit 100 | stats count(*) by objectRef.name as secret | filter verb=\"get\" and objectRef.resource=\"secrets\" The above query will display the number of times a secret has been accessed within a specific timeframe. fields @timestamp, @message | sort @timestamp desc | limit 100 | filter verb=\"get\" and objectRef.resource=\"secrets\" | display objectRef.namespace, objectRef.name, user.username, responseStatus.code This query will display the secret, along with the namespace and username of the user who attempted to access the secret and the response code. Rotate your secrets periodically \u00b6 Kubernetes doesn't automatically rotate secrets. If you have to rotate secrets, consider using an external secret store, e.g. Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. Use separate namespaces as a way to isolate secrets from different applications \u00b6 If you have secrets that cannot be shared between applications in a namespace, create a separate namespace for those applications. Use volume mounts instead of environment variables \u00b6 The values of environment variables can unintentionally appear in logs. Secrets mounted as volumes are instatiated as tmpfs volumes (a RAM backed file system) that are automatically removed from the node when the pod is deleted. Use an external secrets provider \u00b6 There are several viable alternatives to using Kubernetes secrets, include Bitnami's Sealed Secrets and Hashicorp's Vault . Unlike Kubernetes secrets which can be shared amongst all of the pods within a namespace, Vault gives you the ability to limit access to particular pods through the use of Kubernetes service accounts. It also has support for secret rotation. If Vault is not to your liking, you can use similar approach with AWS Secrets Manager, as in this example https://github.com/jicowan/secret-sidecar or you could try using a serverless mutating webhook instead.","title":"Data Encryption and Secrets Management"},{"location":"data/#encryption-at-rest","text":"There are 3 different AWS-native storage options you can use with Kubernetes: EBS , EFS , and FSx for Lustre .

Logs can help with root cause analysis and attribution, i.e. ascribing a change to a particular user. When enough logs have been collected, they can be used to detect anomalous behaviors too. On EKS, the audit logs are sent to Amazon Cloudwatch Logs. The audit policy for EKS currently augments the reference policy in the helper script with the following policy: - level: RequestResponse namespaces: [\"kube-system\"] verbs: [\"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\"] resources: - group: \"\" # core resources: [\"configmaps\"] resourceNames: [\"aws-auth\"] omitStages: - \"RequestReceived\" This logs changes to the aws-auth ConfigMap which is used to grant access to an EKS cluster. Recommendations \u00b6 Enable audit logs \u00b6 The audit logs are part of the EKS managed Kubernetes control plane logs that are managed by EKS. Instructions for enabling/disabling the control plane logs, which includes the logs for the Kubernetes API server, the controller manager, and the scheduler, along with the audit log, can be found here, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html#enabling-control-plane-log-export. Info When you enable control plane logging, you will incur costs for storing the logs in CloudWatch. This raises a broader issue about the ongoing cost of security. Ultimately you will have to weigh those costs against the cost of a security breach, e.g. financial loss, damage to your reputation, etc. You may find that you can adequately secure your environment by implementing only some of the recommendations in this guide. Warning The maximum size for a CWL entry is 256KB whereas the maximum Kubernetes API request size is 1.5MiB. Utilize audit metadata \u00b6 Kubernetes audit logs include two annotations that indicate whether or not a request was authorized authorization.k8s.io/decision and the reason for the decision authorization.k8s.io/reason . Use these attributes to ascertain why a particular API call was allowed. Create alarms for suspicous events \u00b6 Create an alarm to automatically alert you where there is an increase in 403 Forbidden and 401 Unauthorized responses, and then use attributes like host , sourceIPs , and k8s_user.username to find out where those requests are coming from. Analyze logs with Log Insights \u00b6 Use CloudWatch Log Insights to monitor changes to RBAC objects, e.g. roles, rolebindings, clusterroles, and clusterrolebindings. A few sample queries appear below: Lists create, update, delete operations to roles: fields @timestamp, @message | sort @timestamp desc | limit 100 | filter objectRef.resource=\"roles\" and verb in [\"create\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\"] Lists create, update, delete operations to rolebindings: fields @timestamp, @message | sort @timestamp desc | limit 100 | filter objectRef.resource=\"rolebindings\" and verb in [\"create\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\"] Lists create, update, delete operations to clusterroles: fields @timestamp, @message | sort @timestamp desc | limit 100 | filter objectRef.resource=\"clusterroles\" and verb in [\"create\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\"] Lists create, update, delete operations to clusterrolebindings: fields @timestamp, @message | sort @timestamp desc | limit 100 | filter objectRef.resource=\"clusterrolebindings\" and verb in [\"create\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\"] Plots unauthorized read operations against secrets: fields @timestamp, @message | sort @timestamp desc | limit 100 | filter objectRef.resource=\"secrets\" and verb in [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"] and responseStatus.code=\"401\" | count() by bin(1m) List of failed anonymous requests: fields @timestamp, @message, sourceIPs.0 | sort @timestamp desc | limit 100 | filter user.username=\"system:anonymous\" and responseStatus.code in [\"401\", \"403\"] Audit your CloudTrail logs \u00b6 AWS APIs called by pods that are utilizing IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) are automatically logged to CloudTrail along with the name of the service account. If the name of a service account that wasn't explicitly authorized to call an API appears in the log, it may be an indication that the IAM role's trust policy was misconfigured. Generally speaking, Cloudtrail is a great way to ascribe AWS API calls to specific IAM principals. Additional resources \u00b6 As the volume of logs increases, parsing and filtering them with Log Insights or another log analysis tool may become ineffective. As an alternative, you might want to consider running Sysdig Falco and ekscloudwatch . Falco analyzes audit logs and flags anomalies or abuse over an extended period of time. The ekscloudwatch project forwards audit log events from CloudWatch to Falco for analysis. Falco provides a set of default audit rules along with the ability to add your own. Yet another option might be to store the audit logs in S3 and use the SageMaker Random Cut Forest algorithm to anomalous behaviors that warrant further investigation.

This section explores different ways to mitigate risks from attacks launched directly against the host. These guidelines should be used in conjunction with those outlined in the Runtime Security section. Recommendations \u00b6 Use a OS optimized for running containers \u00b6 Conside using Flatcar Linux, Project Atomic, RancherOS, and Bottlerocket (currently in preview), a special purpose OS from AWS designed for running Linux containers. It includes a reduced attack surface, a disk image that is verified on boot, and enforced permission boundaries using SELinux. Treat your infrastructure as immutable and automate the replacement of your worker nodes \u00b6 Rather than performing in-place upgrades, replace your workers when a new patch or update becomes available. This can be approached a couple of ways. You can either add instances to an existing autoscaling group using the latest AMI as you sequentially cordon and drain nodes until all of the nodes in the group have been replaced with the latest AMI. Alternatively, you can add instances to a new node group while you sequentally cordon and drain nodes from the old node group until all of the nodes have been replaced. EKS managed node groups utilizes the second approach and will present an option to upgrade workers when a new AMI becomes available. eksctl also has a mechanism for creating node groups with the latest AMI and for gracefully cordoning and draining pods from nodes groups before the instances are terminated. If you decide to use a different method for replacing your worker nodes, it is strongly recommended that you automate the process to minimize human oversight as you will likely need to replace workers regularly as new updates/patches are released and when the control plane is upgraded. With EKS Fargate, AWS will automatically update the underlying infrastructure as updates become available. Oftentimes this can be done seamlessly, but there may be times when an update will cause your task to be rescheduled. Hence, we recommend that you create deployments with multiple replicas when running your application as a Fargate pod. Periodically run kube-bench to verify compliance with CIS benchmarks for Kubernetes \u00b6 When running kube-bench against an EKS cluster, follow these instructions from Aqua Security, https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench#running-in-an-eks-cluster. Caution false positives may appear in the report because of the way the EKS optimized AMI configures the kubelet. The issue is currently being tracked on GitHub . Minimize access to worker nodes \u00b6 Instead of enabling SSH access, use SSM Session Manager when you need to remote into a host. Unlike SSH keys which can be lost, copied, or shared, Session Manager allows you to control access to EC2 instances using IAM. Moreover, it provides an audit trail and log of the commands that were run on the instance. Deploy workers onto private subnets \u00b6 By deploying workers onto private subnets, you minimize their exposure to the Internet where attacks often originate. At present, worker nodes that are part of a managed node group are automatically assigned a public IP. If you plan to use managed node groups use AWS security groups to restrict or deny inbound access from the Internet (0.0.0.0/0). Risk to workers that are deployed onto public subnets can also be mitigated by implementing restrictive security group rules. Info Starting 22,2020, EKS will be updating the behavior of managed nodes groups to no longer assign public IPs to nodes. After this date, public IP assignment must be controlled via the subnet settings where the node is instantiated. Run Amazon Inspector to assesses hosts for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices \u00b6 Inspector requires the deployment of an agent that continually monitors activity on the instance while using set of rules to assess alignment with best practices. Tip At present, managed node groups do not allow you to supply user metadata or your own AMI. If you want to run Inspector on managed workers, you will need to install the agent after the node has been bootstrapped. Attention Inspector cannot be run on the infrastructure used to run Fargate pods. Alternatives \u00b6 Run SELinux \u00b6 Info Available on RHEL and CoreOS instances SELinux provides an additional layer of security to keep containers isolated from each other and from the host. SELinux allows administrators to enforce mandatory access controls (MAC) for every user, application, process, and file. Think of it as a backstop that restricts access to specific resources on the operation based on a set of labels. On EKS it can be used to prevent containers from accessing each other's resources. SELinux has a module called container_t which general module used for running containers. When you configure SELinux for Docker, Docker automatically labels workloads container_t as a type and gives each container a unique MCS level. This alone will effectively isolate containers from each another. If you need to give it more privileged access to a container, you can create your own profile in SElinux which grants it permissions to specific areas of the file system. This is similiar to PSPs in that you can create different profiles for different containers/pods. For example, you can have a profile for general workloads with a set of restrictive controls and another for things that require privileged access. You can assign SELinux labels using pods or container security context as in the following podSec excerpt: securityContext: seLinuxOptions: # Provide a unique MCS label per container # You can specify user, role, and type also # enforcement based on type and level (svert) level: s0:c144:c154 In this example s0:c144:c154 corresponds to an MCS label assigned to a file that the container is allowed to access. On EKS you could create policies that allow for privileged containers to run, like FluentD and create an SELinux policy to allow it to read from /var/log on the host.

Authentication involves the verification of a indentity whereas authorization governs the actions that can be performed by AWS resources. Within AWS, a resource can be another AWS service, e.g. EC2, or an AWS principle such as an IAM User or Role . The rules governing the actions that a resource is allowed to peform are expressed as IAM policies . Controlling Access to EKS Clusters \u00b6 The Kubernetes project supports a variety of different strategies to authenticate requests to the kube-apiserver service, e.g. Bearer Tokens, X.509 certificates, OIDC, etc. EKS currently has native support for webhook token authentication and serivce account tokens . The webhook authentication strategy calls a webhook that verifies bearer tokens. On EKS, these bearer tokens are generated by the AWS CLI or the aws-iam-authenticator client when you run kubectl commands. As you execute commands, the token is passed to the kube-apiserver which forwards it to the authentication webhook. If the request is well-formed, the webhook calls a pre-signed URL embedded in the token's body. This URL validates the request's signature and returns information about the user, e.g. the user's account, Arn, and UserId to the kube-apiserver. To manually generate a authentication token, type the following command in a terminal window: aws eks get-token --cluster <cluster_name> The output should resemble this: { \"kind\": \"ExecCredential\", \"apiVersion\": \"client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1\", \"spec\": {}, \"status\": { \"expirationTimestamp\": \"2020-02-19T16:08:27Z\", \"token\": \"k8s-aws-v1.aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS8_QWN0aW9uPUdldENhbGxlcklkZW50aXR5JlZlcnNpb249MjAxMS0wNi0xNSZYLUFtei1BbGdvcml0aG09QVdTNC1ITUFDLVNIQTI1NiZYLUFtei1DcmVkZW50aWFsPUFLSUFKTkdSSUxLTlNSQzJXNVFBJTJGMjAyMDAyMTklMkZ1cy1lYXN0LTElMkZzdHMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDIwMDIxOVQxNTU0MjdaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9NjAmWC1BbXotU2lnbmVkSGVhZGVycz1ob3N0JTNCeC1rOHMtYXdzLWlkJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT0yMjBmOGYzNTg1ZTMyMGRkYjVlNjgzYTVjOWE0MDUzMDFhZDc2NTQ2ZjI0ZjI4MTExZmRhZDA5Y2Y2NDhhMzkz\" } } Each token starts with k8s-aws-v1. followed by a base64 encoded string. The string, when decoded, should resemble this: https://sts.amazonaws.com/?Action=GetCallerIdentity&Version=2011-06-15&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJNGRILKNSRC2W5QA%2F20200219%2Fus-east-1%2Fsts%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20200219T155427Z&X-Amz-Expires=60&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host%3Bx-k8s-aws-id&X-Amz-Signature=220f8f3585e320ddb5e683a5c9a405301ad76546f24f28111fdad09cf648a393 The token consists of a pre-signed URL that includes an Amazon credential and signature. For additional see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetCallerIdentity.html. The token has a time to live (TTL) of 15 minutes after which a new token will need to be generated. This is handled automatically when you use a client like kubectl , however, if you're using the Kubernetes dashboard, you will need to generate a new token and re-authenticate each time the token expires. Once the user's identity has been authenticated by the AWS IAM service, the kube-apiserver reads the aws-auth ConfigMap in the kube-system Namespace to determine the RBAC group to associate with the user. The aws-auth ConfigMap is used to create a static mapping betweeen IAM principles, i.e. IAM Users and Roles, and Kubernetes RBAC groups. RBAC groups can be referenced in Kubernetes RoleBindings or ClusterRoleBindings. They are similar to IAM Roles in that they define a set of actions (verbs) that can be peformed against a collection of Kubernetes resources (objects). Recommendations \u00b6 Don't use a service account token for authentication \u00b6 A service account token is a long-lived, static credential. If it is compromised, lost, or stolen, an attacker may be able to perform all the actions associated with that token until the service account is deleted. At times, you may need to grant an exception for applications that have to consume the Kubernetes API from outside the cluster, e.g. a CI/CD pipeline application. If such applications run on AWS infrastructure, like EC2 instances, consider using an instance profile and mapping that to a Kubernetes RBAC role in the aws-auth ConfigMap instead. Employ least privileged access to AWS Resources \u00b6 An IAM User does not need to be assigned privileges to AWS resources to access the Kubernetes API. If you need to grant an IAM user access to an EKS cluster, create an entry in the aws-auth ConfigMap for that user that maps to a specific Kubernetes RBAC group. Use IAM Roles when multiple users need identical access to the cluster \u00b6 Rather than creating an entry for each individual IAM User in the aws-auth ConfigMap, allow those users to assume an IAM Role and map that role to a Kubernetes RBAC group. This will be easier to maintain, especially as the number of users that require access grows. Employ least privilieged access when creating RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings \u00b6 Like the earlier point about granting access to AWS Resources, RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings should only include the set of permissions necessary to perform a specific function. Avoid using [\"*\"] in your Roles and ClusterRoles unless it's absolutely necessary. If you're unsure what permissions to assign, consider using a tool like audit2rbac to automatically generate Roles and binding based on the observed API calls in the Kubernetes Audit Log. Make the EKS Cluster Endpoint private \u00b6 By default when you provision an EKS cluster, the API cluster endpoint is set to public, i.e. it can be accessed from the Internet. Despite being accessible from the Internet, the endpoint is still considered secure because it requires all API requests to be authenticated by IAM and then authorized by Kubernetes RBAC. That said, if your corporate security policy mandates that you restrict access to the API from the Internet or prevents you from routing traffic outside the cluster VPC, you can: Configure the EKS cluster endpoint to be private. See Modifying Cluster Endpoint Access for further information on this topic. Leave the cluster endpoint public and specify which CIDR blocks can communicate with the cluster endpoint. The blocks are effectively a whitelisted set of public IP addresses that are allowed to access the cluster endpoint. Configure public access with a set of whitelisted CIDR blocks and set private endpoint access to enabled. This will allow public access from a specific range of public IPs while forcing all network traffic between the kubelets (workers) and the Kubernetes API through the cross-account ENIs that get provisioned into the cluster VPC when the control plane is provisioned. Regularly audit access to the cluster \u00b6 Who requires access is likely to change over time. Plan to periodically audit the aws-auth ConfigMap to see who has been granted access and the rights they've been assigned. You can also use open source tooling like kubectl-who-can , or rbac-lookup to examine the roles bound to a particular service account, user, or group. We'll explore this topic further when we get to the section on auditing . Additional ideas can be found in this article from nccgroup. Alternative Approaches to Authentication and Access Management \u00b6 While IAM is the preferred way to authenticate users who need access to an EKS cluster, it is possible to use an OIDC identity provider such as GitHub using an authentication proxy and Kubernetes impersonation . Posts for 2 such solutions have been published on the AWS Open Source blog: Authenticating to EKS Using GitHub Credentials with Teleport Consistent OIDC authentication across multiple EKS clusters using kube-oidc-proxy You can also use AWS SSO to federate AWS with an external identity provider, e.g. Azure AD. If you decide to use this, the AWS CLI v2.0 includes an option to create a named profile that makes it easy to associate an SSO session with your current CLI session and assume an IAM role. Know that you must assume a role prior to running kubectl as the IAM role is used to determine the user's Kubernetes RBAC group. Pods Identities \u00b6 Certain applications that run within a Kubernetes cluster need permission to call the Kubernetes API to function properly. For example, the ALB Ingress Controller needs to be able to list a Service's Endpoints. The controller also needs to be able to invoke AWS APIs to provision and configure an ALB. In this section we will explore the best practices for assigning rights and privileges to Pods. Kubernetes Service Accounts \u00b6 A service account is a special type of object that allows you to assign a Kubernetes RBAC role to a pod. A default service account is created automatically for each Namespace within a cluster. When you deploy a pod into a Namespace without referencing a specific service account, the default service account for that Namespace will automatically get assigned to the Pod and the Secret, i.e. the service account (JWT) token for that service account, will get mounted to the pod as a volume at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount . Decoding the service account token in that directory will reveal the following metadata: { \"iss\": \"kubernetes/serviceaccount\", \"kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace\": \"default\", \"kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/secret.name\": \"default-token-5pv4z\", \"kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-account.name\": \"default\", \"kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-account.uid\": \"3b36ddb5-438c-11ea-9438-063a49b60fba\", \"sub\": \"system:serviceaccount:default:default\" } The default service account has the following permissions to the Kubernetes API. apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRole metadata: annotations: rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: \"true\" creationTimestamp: \"2020-01-30T18:13:25Z\" labels: kubernetes.io/bootstrapping: rbac-defaults name: system:discovery resourceVersion: \"43\" selfLink: /apis/rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1/clusterroles/system%3Adiscovery uid: 350d2ab8-438c-11ea-9438-063a49b60fba rules: - nonResourceURLs: - /api - /api/* - /apis - /apis/* - /healthz - /openapi - /openapi/* - /version - /version/ verbs: - get This role authorizes unauthenticated and authenticated users to read API information and is deemed safe to be publicly accessible. When an application running within a Pod calls the Kubernetes APIs, the Pod needs to be assigned a service account that explicitly grants it permission to call those APIs. Similar to guidelines for user access, the Role or ClusterRole bound to a service account should be restricted to the API resources and methods that the application needs to function and nothing else. To use a non-default service account simply set the spec.serviceAccountName field of a Pod to the name of the service account you wish to use. For additional information about creating service accounts, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#service-account-permissions. IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) \u00b6 IRSA is a feature that allows you to assign an IAM role to a Kubernetes service account. It works by leveraging a Kubernetes feature known as Service Account Token Volume Projection . Pods with service accounts that reference an IAM Role call a public OIDC discovery endpoint for AWS IAM upon startup. The endpoint cyrptographically signs the OIDC token issued by Kubernetes which ultimately allows the Pod to call the AWS APIs associated IAM role.

Recommendations \u00b6 Disable auto-mounting of service account tokens \u00b6 If your application doesn't need to call the Kubernetes API set the automountServiceAccountToken attribute to false in the PodSpec for your application or patch the default service account in each namespace so that it's no longer mounted to pods automatically. For example: kubectl patch serviceaccount default -p $'automountServiceAccountToken: false' Use dedicated service accounts for each application \u00b6 Each application should have its own dedicated service account. This applies to service accounts for the Kubernetes API as well as IRSA. Attention If you employ a blue/green approach to cluster upgrades instead of performing an in-place cluster upgrade, you will need to update the trust policy of each of the IRSA IAM roles with the OIDC endpoint of the new cluster. A blue/green cluster upgrade is where you create a cluster running a newer version of Kubernetes alongside the old cluster and use a load balancer or a service mesh to seamlessly shift traffic from services running on the old cluster to the new cluster. Restrict access to the instance profile assigned to the worker node \u00b6 When you use IRSA, the Pod no longer inherits the rights of the instance profile assigned to the worker node. Nonetheless, as an added precaution, you may want to block a process's ability to access instance metadata . This will effectively prevent pods that do not use IRSA from inheriting the role assigned to the worker node. Be aware that when you block access to instance metadata on a worker node, it may prevent certain pods from functioning properly. For additional information about how to block access to instance metadata, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/restrict-ec2-credential-access.html. Run the application as a non-root user \u00b6 Containers run as root by default. While this allows them to to read the web identity token file, running a container as root is not considered a best practice. As an alternative, consider adding the spec.securityContext.runAsUser attribute to the PodSpec. The value of runAsUser is abritrary value. In the following example, all processes within the Pod will run under the user ID specified in the runAsUser field. apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: security-context-demo spec: securityContext: runAsUser: 1000 runAsGroup: 3000 containers: - name: sec-ctx-demo image: busybox command: [ \"sh\", \"-c\", \"sleep 1h\" ] Scope the IAM Role trust policy for IRSA to the service account name \u00b6 The trust policy can be scoped to a Namespace or a specific service account within a Namespace. When using IRSA it's best to make the role trust policy as explicit as possible by including the service account name. This will effectively prevent other Pods within the same Namespace from assuming the role. The CLI eksctl will do this automatically when you use it to create service accounts/IAM roles. See https://eksctl.io/usage/iamserviceaccounts/ for futher information. Alternative approaches \u00b6 While IRSA is the preferred way to assign an AWS \"identity\" to a pod, it requires that you include recent version of the AWS SDKs in your application. For a complete listing of the SDKs that currently support IRSA, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts-minimum-sdk.html. If you have an application that you can't immediately update with a IRSA-compatible SDK, there are several community-built solutions available for assigning IAM roles to Kubernetes pods, including kube2iam and kiam . Although AWS doesn't endorse or condone the use of these solutions, they are frequently used by the community at large to achieve similar results as IRSA.","title":"Identity and Access Management"},{"location":"iam/#identity-and-access-management","text":"Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an AWS service that performs two essential functions: Authentication and Authorization.

The webhook authentication strategy calls a webhook that verifies bearer tokens. On EKS, these bearer tokens are generated by the AWS CLI or the aws-iam-authenticator client when you run kubectl commands. As you execute commands, the token is passed to the kube-apiserver which forwards it to the authentication webhook. If the request is well-formed, the webhook calls a pre-signed URL embedded in the token's body. This URL validates the request's signature and returns information about the user, e.g. the user's account, Arn, and UserId to the kube-apiserver.

This is handled automatically when you use a client like kubectl , however, if you're using the Kubernetes dashboard, you will need to generate a new token and re-authenticate each time the token expires. Once the user's identity has been authenticated by the AWS IAM service, the kube-apiserver reads the aws-auth ConfigMap in the kube-system Namespace to determine the RBAC group to associate with the user. The aws-auth ConfigMap is used to create a static mapping betweeen IAM principles, i.e. IAM Users and Roles, and Kubernetes RBAC groups. RBAC groups can be referenced in Kubernetes RoleBindings or ClusterRoleBindings.

That said, if your corporate security policy mandates that you restrict access to the API from the Internet or prevents you from routing traffic outside the cluster VPC, you can: Configure the EKS cluster endpoint to be private. See Modifying Cluster Endpoint Access for further information on this topic. Leave the cluster endpoint public and specify which CIDR blocks can communicate with the cluster endpoint. The blocks are effectively a whitelisted set of public IP addresses that are allowed to access the cluster endpoint. Configure public access with a set of whitelisted CIDR blocks and set private endpoint access to enabled.

You can find the files with SETUID and SETGID bits with the following command: find / -perm +6000 -type f -exec ls -ld {} \\; To remove the special permissions from these files, add the following directive to your container image: RUN find / -xdev -perm +6000 -type f -exec chmod a-s {} \\; || true Colloquially, this is known as de-fanging your image. Use multi-stage builds \u00b6 Using multi-stage builds is a way to create minimal images. Oftentimes, multi-stage builds are used to automate parts of the Continuous Integration cycle. For example, multi-stage builds can be used to lint your source code or perform static code analysis. This affords developers an opportunity to get near immediate feedback instead of waiting for a pipeline to execute. Multi-stage builds are attractive from a security standpoint because they allow you to minimize the size of the final image pushed to your container registry. Container images devoid of build tools and other extraneous binaries improves your security posture by reducing the attack surface of the image. For additional information about multi-stage builds, see https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/. Scan images for vulnerabilities regularly \u00b6 Like their virtual machine counterparts, container images can contain binaries and application libraries with vulnerabilities or develop vulnerabilities over time. The best way to safeguard against exploits is by regularly scanning your images with an image scanner. Images that are stored in Amazon ECR can be scanned on push or on-demand (once during a 24 hour period). ECR currently leverages Clair an open source image scanning solution. After an image is scanned, the results are logged to the event stream for ECR in EventBridge. You can also see the results of a scan from within the ECR console. Images with a HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerability should be deleted or rebuilt. If an image that has been deployed develops a vulnerability, it should be replaced as soon as possible. Knowing where images with vulnerabilities have been deployed is essential to keeping your environment secure. While you could conceivably build an image tracking solution yourself, there are already several commercial offerings that provide this and other advanced capabilities out of the box, including: + Anchore + Twistlock + Aqua + Kubei A Kubernetes validation webhook could also be used to validate that images are free of critical vulnerabilities. Validation webhooks are invoked prior to the Kubernetes API. They are typically used to reject requests that don't comply with the validation criteria defined in the webhook. This is an example of a serverless webhook that calls the ECR describeImageScanFindings API to deteremine whether a pod is pulling an image with critical vulnerabilities. If vulnerabilities are found, the pod is rejected and a message with list of CVEs is returned as an Event. Create IAM policies for ECR repositories \u00b6 Nowadays, it is not uncommon for an organization to have multiple development teams operating independently within a shared AWS account. If these teams don't need to share assets, you may want to create a set of IAM policies that restrict access to the repositories each team can interact with. A good way to implement this is by using ECR namespaces . Namespaces are a way to group similar repositories together. For example, all of the registries for team A can be prefaced with the team-a/ while those for team B can use the team-b/ prefix. The policy to restrict access might look like the following: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [{ \"Sid\": \"AllowPushPull\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/<team_a_role_name>\" }, \"Action\": [ \"ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer\", \"ecr:BatchGetImage\", \"ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability\", \"ecr:PutImage\", \"ecr:InitiateLayerUpload\", \"ecr:UploadLayerPart\", \"ecr:CompleteLayerUpload\" ], \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:ecr:region:123456789012:repository/team-a/*\" ] }] } Consider using ECR private endpoints \u00b6 The ECR API has a public endpoint. Consequently, ECR registries can be accessed from the Internet so long as the request has been authenticated and authorized by IAM. For those who need to operate in a sandboxed environment where the cluster VPC lacks an Internet Gateway (IGW), you can configure a private endpoint for ECR. Creating a private endpoint enables you to privately access the ECR API through a private IP address instead of routing traffic across the Internet. For additional information on this topic, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html. Implement endpoint policies for ECR \u00b6 The default endpoint policy for allows access to all ECR repositories within a region. This might allow an attacker/insider to exfiltrate data by packaging it as a container image and pushing it to a registry in another AWS account. Mitigating this risk involves creating an endpoint policy that limits API access to ECR respositories. For example, the following policy allows all AWS principles in your account to perform all actions against your and only your ECR repositories: { \"Statement\": [{ \"Sid\": \"LimitECRAccess\", \"Principal\": \"*\", \"Action\": \"*\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:ecr:region:<your_account_id>:repository/*\" }, ] } You can enhance this further by setting a condition that uses the new PrincipalOrgID attribute which will prevent pushing/pulling of images by an IAM principle that is not part of your AWS Organization. See, aws:PrincipalOrgID for additional details. We recommended applying the same policy to both the com.amazonaws.<region>.ecr.dkr and the com.amazonaws.<region>.ecr.api endpoints. Since EKS pulls images for kube-proxy, coredns, and aws-node from ECR, you will need to add the account ID of the registry, e.g. 602401143452.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/* to the list of resources in the endpoint policy or alter the policy to allow pulls from \"*\" and restrict pushes to your account ID. The table below reveals the mapping between the AWS accounts where EKS images are vended from and cluster region. Account Number Region 602401143452 All commercial regions except for those listed below 800184023465 HKG 558608220178 BAH 918309763551 BJS 961992271922 ZHY For further information about using endpoint policies, see Using VPC endpoint policies to control Amazon ECR access . Create a set of curated images \u00b6 Rather than allowing developers to create their own images, consider creating a set of vetted images for the different application stacks in your organization. By doing so, developers can forego learning how to compose Dockerfiles and concentrate on writing code. As changes are merged into Master, a CI/CD pipeline can automatically compile the asset, store it in an artifact repository and copy the artifact into the appropriate image before pushing it to a Docker registry like ECR. At the very least you should create a set of base images from which developers to create their own Dockerfiles. Ideally, you want to avoid pulling images from Dockerhub because a) you don't always know what is in the image and b) about a fifth of the top 1000 images have vulnerabilties. A list of those images and their vulnerabilities can be found at https://vulnerablecontainers.org/. Add the USER directive to your Dockerfiles to run as a non-root user \u00b6 As was mentioned in the pod security section, you should avoid running container as root. While you can configure this as part of the podSpec, it is a good habit to use the USER directive to your Dockerfiles. The USER directive sets the UID to use when running RUN , ENTRYPOINT , or CMD instruction that appears after the USER directive. Lint your Dockerfiles \u00b6 Linting can be used to verify that your Dockerfiles are adhering to a set of predefined guidelines, e.g. the inclusion of the USER directive or the requirement that all images be tagged. dockerfile_lint is an open source project from RedHat that verifies common best practices and includes a rule engine that you can use to build your own rules for linting Dockerfiles. It can be incorporated into a CI pipeline, in that builds with Dockerfiles that violate a rule will automatically fail. Build images from Scratch \u00b6 Reducing the attack surface of your container images should be primary aim when building images. The ideal way to do this is by creating minimal images that are devoid of binaries that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities. Fortunately, Docker has a mechanism to create images from scratch . With langages like Go, you can create a static linked binary and reference it in your Dockerfile as in this example: ############################ # STEP 1 build executable binary ############################ FROM golang:alpine AS builder # Install git. # Git is required for fetching the dependencies. RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache git WORKDIR $GOPATH/src/mypackage/myapp/ COPY . . # Fetch dependencies. # Using go get. RUN go get -d -v # Build the binary. RUN go build -o /go/bin/hello ############################ # STEP 2 build a small image ############################ FROM scratch # Copy our static executable. COPY --from=builder /go/bin/hello /go/bin/hello # Run the hello binary. ENTRYPOINT [\"/go/bin/hello\"] This creates a container image that consists of your application and nothing else, making it extremely secure. Sign your images \u00b6 When Docker was first introduced, there was no cryptographic model for verifying container images. With v2, Docker added digests to the image manifest. This allowed an image\u2019s configuration to be hashed and for the hash to be used to generate an ID for the image. When image signing is enabled, the [Docker] engine verifies the manifest\u2019s signature, ensuring that the content was produced from a trusted source and no tampering has occurred. After each layer is downloaded, the engine verifies the digest of the layer, ensuring that the content matches the content specified in the manifest. Image signing effectively allows you to create a secure supply chain, through the verification of digital signatures associated with the image. In a Kubernetes environment, you can use an dynamic admission controller to verify that an image has been signed, as in these examples: https://github.com/IBM/portieris and https://github.com/kelseyhightower/grafeas-tutorial. By signing your images, you're verifying the publisher (source) ensuring that the image hasn't been tampered with (integrity).

For example, Namespaces and Role-based access controls (RBAC) can be implemented to logically isolate tenants from each other. Similarly, Quotas and Limit Ranges can be used to control the amount of cluster resources each tenant can consume. Nevertheless, the cluster is the only construct that provides a strong security boundary. This is because an attacker that manages to gain access to a host within the cluster can retrieve all Secrets, ConfigMaps, and Volumes, mounted on that host. They could also impersonate the Kubelet which would allow them to manipulate the attributes of the node and/or move laterally within the cluster. The following sections will explain how to implement tenant isolation while mitigating the risks of using a single tenant orchestrator like Kubernetes. Soft multi-tenancy \u00b6 With soft multi-tenancy, you use native Kubernetes constructs, e.g. namespaces, roles and role bindings, and network policies, to create logical separation between tenants. RBAC, for example, can prevent tenants from accessing or manipulate each other's resources. Quotas and limit ranges control the amount of cluster resources each tenant can consume while network policies can help prevent applications deployed into different namespaces from communicating with each other. None of these controls, however, prevent pods from different tenants from sharing a node. If stronger isolation is required, you can use a node selector, anti-affinity rules, and/or taints and tolerations to force pods from different tenants to be scheduled onto separate nodes; often referred to as sole tenant nodes . This could get rather complicated, and cost prohibitive, in an environment with many tenants. !!! attention Soft multi-tenancy implemented with Namespaces does not allow you to provide tenants with a filtered list of Namespaces because Namespaces are a globaly scoped Type. If a tenant has the ability to view a particular Namespace, it can view all Namespaces within the cluster. Kiosk is an open source project that can aid in the implementation of soft multi-tenancy. It is implemented as a series of CRDs and controllers that provide the following capabilities: Accounts & Account Users to separate tenants in a shared Kubernetes cluster Self-Service Namespace Provisioning for account users Account Limits to ensure quality of service and fairness when sharing a cluster Namespace Templates for secure tenant isolation and self-service namespace initialization There are 3 primary use cases that can be addressed by soft multi-tenancy. Enterprise Setting \u00b6 The first is in an Enterprise setting where the \"tenants\" are semi-trusted in that they are employees, contractors, or are otherwise authorized by the organization. Each tenant will typically align to an administrative division such as a department or team. In this type of setting, a cluster administrator will usually be responsible for creating namespaces and managing policies. They may also implement a delegated adminstration model where certain individuals are given oversight of a namespace, allowing them to perform CRUD operations for non-policy related objects like deployments, services, pods, jobs, etc. The isolation provided by Docker may be acceptable within this setting or it may need to be augmented with additional controls such as Pod Security Policies (PSPs). It may also be necessary to restrict communication between services in different namespaces if stricter isolation is required. Kubernetes as a Service \u00b6 By constrast, soft multi-tenancy can be used in settings where you want to offer Kubernetes as a service (KaaS). With KaaS, your application is hosted in a shared cluster along with a collection of controllers and CRDs that provide a set of PaaS services. Tenants interact directly with the Kubernetes API server and are permitted to perform CRUD operations on non-policy objects. There is also an element of self-service in that tenants may be allowed to create and manage their own namespaces. In this type of environment, tenants are assumed to be running untrusted code. To isolate tenants in this type of environment, you will likely need to implement strict network policies as well as pod sandboxing . Sandboxing is where you run the containers of a pod inside a micro VM like Firecracker or in a user-space kernel. Today, you can create sandboxed pods with EKS Fargate. Software as a Service (SaaS) \u00b6 The final use case for soft multi-tenancy is in a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) setting. In this environment, each tenant is associated with a particular instance of an application that's running within the cluster. Each instance often has its own data and uses separate access controls that are usually independent of Kubernetes RBAC. Unlike the other use cases, the tenant in a SaaS setting does not directly interface with the Kubernetes API. Instead, the SaaS application is responsible for interfacing with the Kubernetes API to create the necessary objects to support each tenant. Kubernetes Constructs \u00b6 In each of these instances the following constructs are used to isolate tenants from each other: Namespaces \u00b6 Namespaces are fundamental to implementing soft multi-tenancy. They allow you to divide the cluster into logical partitions. Quotas, network policies, service accounts, and other objects needed to implement multi-tenancy are scoped to a namespace. Network policies \u00b6 By default, all pods in a Kubernetes cluster are allowed to communicate with each other. This behavior can be altered using network policies. Network policies restrict communication between pods using labels or IP address ranges. In a multi-tenant environment where strict network isolation between tenants is required, we recommend starting with a default rule that denies communication between pods, and another rule that allows all pods to query the DNS server for name resolution. With that in place, you can begin adding more permissive rules that allow for communication within a namespace. This can be further refined as required. !!! attention Network policies are necessary but not sufficient. The enforcement of network policies requires a policy engine such as Calico or Cilium. Role-based access control (RBAC) \u00b6 Roles and role bindings are the Kubernetes objects used to enforce role-based access control (RBAC) in Kubernetes. Roles contain lists of actions that can be performed against objects in your cluster. Role bindings specify the individuals or groups to whom the roles apply. In the enterprise and KaaS settings, RBAC can be used to permit administration of objects by selected groups or individuals. Quotas \u00b6 Quotas are used to define limits on workloads hosted in your cluster. With quotas, you can specify the maximum amount of CPU and memory that a pod can consume, or you can limit the number of resources that can be allocated in a cluster or namespace. Limit ranges allow you to declare minimum, maximum, and default values for each limit. Overcommitting resources in a shared cluster is often beneficial because it allows you maximize your resources. However, unbounded access to a cluster can cause resource starvation, which can lead to performance degradation and loss of application availability. If a pod's requests are set too low and the actual resource utilization exceeds the capacity of the node, the node will begin to experience CPU or memory pressure. When this happens, pods may be restarted and/or evicted from the node. To prevent this from happening, you should plan to impose quotas on namespaces in a multi-tenant environment to force tenants to specify requests and limits when scheduling their pods on the cluster. It will also mitigate a potential denial of service by contraining the amount of resources a pod can consume. You can also use quotas to apportion the cluster's resources to align with a tenant's spend. This is particularly useful in the KaaS scenario. Pod priority and pre-emption \u00b6 Pod priority and pre-emption can be useful when you want to provide different qualties of services (QoS) for different customers. For example, with pod priority you can configure pods from customer A to run at a higher priority than customer B. When there's insufficient capacity available, the Kubelet will evict the lower-priority pods from customer B to accommodate the higher-priority pods from customer A. This can be especially handy in a SaaS environment where customers willing to pay a premium receive a higher quality of service. Mitigating controls \u00b6 Your chief concern as an administrator of a multi-tenant environment is preventing an attacker from gaining access to the underlying host. The following controls should be considered to mitigate this risk: Pod Security Policies (PSPs) \u00b6 PSPs should be used to curtail the actions that can be performed by a container and to reduce a container's privileges, e.g. running as a non-root user. Sandboxed execution environments for containers \u00b6 Sandboxing is a technique by which each container is run in its own isolated virtual machine. Technologies that perform pod sandboxing include Firecracker and Weave's Firekube . If you are building your own self-managed Kubernetes cluster on AWS, you may be able to configure alternate container runtimes such as Kata Containers . For additional information about the effort to make Firecracker a supported runtime for EKS, See https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1238496944684597248.html. Open Policy Agent (OPA) & Gatekeeper \u00b6 Gatekeeper is a Kubernetes admission controller that enforces policies created with OPA . With OPA you can create a policy that runs pods from tenants on separate instances or at a higher priority than other tenants. Hard multi-tenancy \u00b6 Hard multi-tenancy can be implemented by provisioning separate clusters for each tenant. While this provides very strong isolation between tenants, it has several drawbacks. First, when you have many tenants, this approach can quickly become expensive. Not only will you have to pay for the control plane costs for each cluster, you will not be able to share compute resources between clusters. This will eventually cause fragmentation where subset of your clusters are underutilized while others are overutilized. Second, you will likely need to buy or build special tooling to manage all of these clusters. In time, managing hundreds or thousands of clusters may simply become too unweildy. Finally, creating a cluster per tenant will be slow relative to a creating a namespace. Nevertheless, a hard-tenancy approach may be necessary in highly-regulated industries or in SaaS environments where strong isolation is required. Future directions \u00b6 The Kubernetes community has recognized the current shortcomings of soft multi-tenancy and the challenges with hard multi-tenancy. The Multi-Tenancy Special Interest Group (SIG) is attempting to address these shortcomings through several incubation projects, including Hierarchical Namespace Controller (HNC) and Virtual Cluster. The HNC proposal (KEP) describes a way to create parent-child relationships between namespaces with [policy] object inheritance along with an ability for tenant administrators to create subnamespaces. The Virtual Cluster proposal describes a mechanism for creating separate instances of the control plane services, including the API server, the controller manager, and scheduler, for each tenant within the cluster (also known as \"Kubernetes on Kubernetes\").

The first involves the application of rules which restrict the flow of network traffic between services. The second involves the encryption of traffic while it is in transit. The mechanisms to implement these security measures on EKS are varied but often include the following items: Traffic control \u00b6 Network Policies Security Groups Encryption in transit \u00b6 Service Mesh Container Network Interfaces (CNIs) Nitro Instances Network policy \u00b6 Within a Kubernetes cluster, all Pod to Pod communication is allowed by default. While this flexibility may help promote experimentation, it is not considered secure. Kubernetes network policies give you a mechanism to restrict network traffic between Pods (often referred to as East/West traffic) and between Pods and external services. Calico , is an open source policy engine from Tigera that works well with EKS. Network policies operate at layers 3 and 4 of the OSI model. Rules can comprise of a source and destination IP address, port number, protocol number, or a combination of these. Isovalent, the maintainers of Cilium , have extended the network policies to include partial support for layer 7 rules, e.g. HTTP. Cilium also has support for DNS hostnames which can be useful for restricting traffic between Kubernetes Services/Pods and resources that run within or outside of your VPC. By contrast, Tigera Enterprise includes a feature that allows you to map a Kubernetes network policy to an AWS security group. Attention When you first provision an EKS cluster, the Calico policy engine is not installed by default. The manifests for installing Calico can be found in the VPC CNI repository at https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/tree/master/config. Calico policies can be scoped to Namespaces, Pods, service accounts, or globally. When policies are scoped to a service account, it associates a set of ingress/egress rules with that service account. With the proper RBAC rules in place, you can prevent teams from overriding these rules, allowing IT security professionals to safely delegate administration of namespaces. You can find a list of common Kubernetes network policies at https://github.com/ahmetb/kubernetes-network-policy-recipes. A similar set of rules for Calico are available at https://docs.projectcalico.org/security/calico-network-policy. Recommendations \u00b6 Create a default deny policy \u00b6 As with RBAC policies, network policies should adhere to the policy of least privileged access. Start by creating a deny all policy that restricts all inbound and outbound traffic from a namespace or create a global policy using Calico. Kubernetes network policy apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: default-deny namespace: default spec: podSelector: {} policyTypes: - Ingress - Egress Tip The image above was created by the network policy viewer from Tufin . Calico global network policy apiVersion: crd.projectcalico.org/v1 kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy metadata: name: default-deny spec: selector: all() types: - Ingress - Egress Create a rule to allow DNS queries \u00b6 Once you have the defaul deny all rule in place, you can begin layering on additional rules, such as a global rule that allows pods to query CoreDNS for name resolution. You begin by labeling the namespace: kubectl label namespace kube-system name=kube-system Then add the network policy: apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: allow-dns-access namespace: default spec: podSelector: matchLabels: {} policyTypes: - Egress egress: - to: - namespaceSelector: matchLabels: name: kube-system ports: - protocol: UDP port: 53 Calico global policy equivalent apiVersion: crd.projectcalico.org/v1 kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy metadata: name: allow-dns-egress spec: selector: all() types: - Egress egress: - action: Allow protocol: UDP destination: namespaceSelector: name == \"kube-system\" ports: - 53 The following is an example of how to associate a network policy with a service account while preventing users associated with the readonly-sa-group from editing the service account my-sa in the default namespace: apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: name: my-sa namespace: default labels: name: my-sa --- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: Role metadata: namespace: default name: readonly-sa-role rules: # Allows the subject to read a service account called my-sa - apiGroups: [\"\"] resources: [\"serviceaccounts\"] resourceNames: [\"my-sa\"] verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"] --- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: RoleBinding metadata: namespace: default name: readonly-sa-rolebinding # Binds the readonly-sa-role to the RBAC group called readonly-sa-group. subjects: - kind: Group name: readonly-sa-group apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io roleRef: kind: Role name: readonly-sa-role apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io --- apiVersion: crd.projectcalico.org/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: netpol-sa-demo namespace: default # Allows all ingress traffic to services in the default namespace that reference # the service account called my-sa spec: ingress: - action: Allow source: serviceAccounts: selector: 'name == \"my-sa\"' selector: all() Incrementally add rules to selectively allow the flow of traffic between namespaces/pods \u00b6 Start by allowing Pods within a Namespace to communicate with each other and then add custom rules that further restrict Pod to Pod communication within that Namespace. Log network traffic metadata \u00b6 AWS VPC Flow Logs captures metadata about the traffic flowing through a VPC, such as source and destination IP address and port along with accepted/dropped packets. This information could be analyzed to look for suspicous or unusual activity between resources within the VPC, including Pods. However, since the IP addresses of pods frequently change as they are replaced, Flow Logs may not be sufficient on its own. Calico Enterprise extends the Flow Logs with pod labels and other metadata, making it easier to decipher the traffic flows between pods. Use encryption with AWS load balancers \u00b6 The AWS Appliation Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB) both have support for transport encryption (SSL and TLS). The alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn annotation for the ALB lets you to specify which certificates to add to the ALB. If you omit the annotation the controller will attempt to add certificates to listeners that require it by matching the available AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certiciates using the host field. Starting with EKS v1.15 you can use the service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert annotation with the NLB as shown in the example below. apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: demo-app namespace: default labels: app: demo-app annotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: \"nlb\" service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: \"<certificate ARN>\" service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports: \"443\" service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: \"http\" spec: type: LoadBalancer ports: - port: 443 targetPort: 80 protocol: TCP selector: app: demo-app --- kind: Deployment apiVersion: apps/v1 metadata: name: nginx namespace: default labels: app: demo-app spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: demo-app template: metadata: labels: app: demo-app spec: containers: - name: nginx image: nginx ports: - containerPort: 443 protocol: TCP - containerPort: 80 protocol: TCP Additional Resources \u00b6 Kubernetes & Tigera: Network Policies, Security, and Audit Calico Enterprise Cilium Kinvolk's Network Policy Advisor Suggests network policies based on an analysis of network traffic Security groups \u00b6 EKS uses AWS VPC Security Groups (SGs) to control the traffic between the Kubernetes control plane and the cluster's worker nodes. Security groups are also used to control the traffic between worker nodes, worker nodes and other VPC resources, and external IP addresses. When you provision an EKS cluster (with Kubernetes version 1.14-eks.3 or greater), a cluster security group is automatically created for you. The security group allows unfettered communication between the EKS control plane and the nodes from managed node groups. For simplicity, it is recommended that you add the cluster SG to all node groups, including unmanaged node groups. Prior to 1.14 platform version eks.3 there were separate security groups configured for the EKS control plane and node groups. The minimum and suggested rules for the control plane and node group security groups can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/sec-group-reqs.html. The minimum rules for the control plane security group allows port 443 inbound from the worker node SG and is there for securely communicating with the Kubernetes API server. It also allows port 10250 outbound to the worker node SG; 10250 is the port that the kubelet listens on. The minimum node group rules allow port 10250 inbound from the control plane SG and 443 outbound to the control plane SG. Finally there is a rule that allows unfettered communication between nodes within a node group. If you need to control communication between services that run within the cluster and service the run outside the cluster, consider using a network policy engine like Cilium which allows you to use a DNS name. Alternatively, use Calico Enterprise which allows you to map a network policy to an AWS security group. If you're implemting a service mesh like Istio, you can use an egress gateway to restrict network egress to specific fully qualified domains or IP addresses. Read the 3 part series on egress traffic control in Istio for further information. Caution Unless you are running 1 pod per instance or dedicating a set of instances to run a particular application, security groups are considered to be too course grained to control network traffic. Contemplate using network policies which are Kubernetes-aware instead. Encryption in transit \u00b6 Applications that need to conform to PCI, HIPAA, or other regulations may need to encrypt data while it is in transit. Nowadays TLS is the de facto choice for encrypting traffic on the wire. TLS, like it's predecessor SSL, provides secure communications over a network using cyptographic protocols. TLS uses symmetric encryption where the keys to encrypt the data are generated based on a shared secret that is negotiated at the beginning of the session. The following are a few ways that you can encrypt data in a Kubernetes environment. Nitro Instances \u00b6 Traffic exchanged between select Nitro instance types, e.g. M5n, M5dn, R5n, and R5dn, is automatically encrypted by default. When there's an intermediate hop, like a transit gateway or a load balancer, the traffic is not encrypted. The What's New announcement, Introducing Amazon EC2 M5n, M5dn, R5n and R5dn Instances provides additional information about these instance types. Container Network Interfaces (CNIs) \u00b6 WeaveNet can be configured to automatically encrypt all traffic using NaCl encryption for sleeve traffic, and IPsec ESP for fast datapath traffic. Service Mesh \u00b6 Encryption in transit can also be implemented with a service mesh like App Mesh, Linkerd v2, and Istio. Currently, App Mesh supports TLS encryption with a private certificate issued by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) or a certificate stored on the local file system of the virtual node. Linkerd and Istio both have support for mTLS which adds another layer of security through mutual exchange and validation of certificates.

Oftentimes, these Ingresses are fronted by a layer 4 load balancer, like the Classic Load Balancer or the Network Load Balancer (NLB). Encrypted traffic can be terminated at different places within the network, e.g. at the load balancer, at the ingress resource, or the Pod. How and where you terminate your SSL connection will ultimately be dictated by your organization's network security policy. For instance, if you have a policy that requires end-to-end encryption, you will have to decrypt the traffic at the Pod. This will place additional burden on your Pod as it will have to spend cycles establishing the initial handshake. Overall SSL/TLS processing is very CPU intensive. Consequently, if have the flexibility, try performing the SSL offload at the Ingress or the load balancer. An ingress controller can be configured to terminate SSL/TLS connections.

Calico , is an open source policy engine from Tigera that works well with EKS. Network policies operate at layers 3 and 4 of the OSI model. Rules can comprise of a source and destination IP address, port number, protocol number, or a combination of these. Isovalent, the maintainers of Cilium , have extended the network policies to include partial support for layer 7 rules, e.g. HTTP. Cilium also has support for DNS hostnames which can be useful for restricting traffic between Kubernetes Services/Pods and resources that run within or outside of your VPC. By contrast, Tigera Enterprise includes a feature that allows you to map a Kubernetes network policy to an AWS security group. Attention When you first provision an EKS cluster, the Calico policy engine is not installed by default. The manifests for installing Calico can be found in the VPC CNI repository at https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/tree/master/config. Calico policies can be scoped to Namespaces, Pods, service accounts, or globally. When policies are scoped to a service account, it associates a set of ingress/egress rules with that service account. With the proper RBAC rules in place, you can prevent teams from overriding these rules, allowing IT security professionals to safely delegate administration of namespaces.

The security group allows unfettered communication between the EKS control plane and the nodes from managed node groups. For simplicity, it is recommended that you add the cluster SG to all node groups, including unmanaged node groups. Prior to 1.14 platform version eks.3 there were separate security groups configured for the EKS control plane and node groups. The minimum and suggested rules for the control plane and node group security groups can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/sec-group-reqs.html. The minimum rules for the control plane security group allows port 443 inbound from the worker node SG and is there for securely communicating with the Kubernetes API server. It also allows port 10250 outbound to the worker node SG; 10250 is the port that the kubelet listens on. The minimum node group rules allow port 10250 inbound from the control plane SG and 443 outbound to the control plane SG.

As a Kubernetes practitioner your chief concern should be preventing a process that\u2019s running in a container from escaping the isolation boundaries of Docker and gaining access to the underlying host. The reason for this is twofold. First, the processes that run within a container run under the context of the [Linux] root user by default. Although the actions of root within a container are partially constrained by the set of Linux capabilities that Docker assigns to the containers, these default privileges could allow an attacker to escalate their privileges and/or gain access to sensitive information bound to the host, including Secrets and ConfigMaps. Below is a list of the default capabilities assigned to Docker containers. For additional information about each capability, see http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html.

Additionally, Linux capabilities can only be dropped from Fargate pods. Pods that are run as privileged, inherit all of the Linux capabilities associated with root on the host and should be avoided if possible. Second, all Kubernetes worker nodes use an authorization mode called the node authorizer. The node authorizer authorizes all API requests that originate from the kubelet and allows nodes to perform the following actions: Read operations: services endpoints nodes pods secrets, configmaps, persistent volume claims and persistent volumes related to pods bound to the kubelet\u2019s node Write operations: nodes and node status (enable the NodeRestriction admission plugin to limit a kubelet to modify its own node) pods and pod status (enable the NodeRestriction admission plugin to limit a kubelet to modify pods bound to itself) events Auth-related operations: read/write access to the certificationsigningrequests API for TLS bootstrapping the ability to create tokenreviews and subjectaccessreviews for delegated authentication/authorization checks EKS uses the node restriction admission controller which only allows the node to modify a limited set of node attributes and pod objects that are bound to the node. Nevertheless, an attacker who manages to get access to the host will still be able to glean sensitive information about the environment from the Kubernetes API that could allow them to move laterally within the cluster. Recommendations \u00b6 Restrict the containers that can run as privileged \u00b6 As mentioned, containers that run as privileged inherit all of the Linux capabilities assigned to root on the host. Seldom do containers need these types of privileges to function properly. You can reject pods with containers configured to run as privileged by creating a pod security policy . You can think of a pod security policy as a set requirements that pods have to meet before they can be created. If you elect to use pod security policies, you will need to create a role binding that allows service accounts to read your pod security policies. When you provision an EKS cluster, a pod security policy called eks.privileged is automatically created. The manifest for that policy appears below: apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: PodSecurityPolicy metadata: annotations: kubernetes.io/description: privileged allows full unrestricted access to pod features, as if the PodSecurityPolicy controller was not enabled. seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: '*' labels: eks.amazonaws.com/component: pod-security-policy kubernetes.io/cluster-service: \"true\" name: eks.privileged spec: allowPrivilegeEscalation: true allowedCapabilities: - '*' fsGroup: rule: RunAsAny hostIPC: true hostNetwork: true hostPID: true hostPorts: - max: 65535 min: 0 privileged: true runAsUser: rule: RunAsAny seLinux: rule: RunAsAny supplementalGroups: rule: RunAsAny volumes: - '*' This PSP allows an authenticated user to run privileged containers across all namespaces within the cluster. While this may seem overly permissive at first, there are certain applications/plug-ins such as the AWS VPC CNI and kube-proxy that have to run as privileged because they are responsible for configuring the host\u2019s network settings. Furthermore, this policy provides backward compatibility with earlier versions of Kubernetes that lacked support for pod security policies. The binding shown below is what binds the ClusterRole eks:podsecuritypolicy:privileged to the system:authenticated RBAC group. apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: annotations: kubernetes.io/description: Allow all authenticated users to create privileged labels: eks.amazonaws.com/component: pod-security-policy kubernetes.io/cluster-service: \"true\" name: eks:podsecuritypolicy:authenticated roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: ClusterRole name: eks:podsecuritypolicy:privileged subjects: - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Group name: system:authenticated Lastly, the ClusterRole below allow all bindings that reference it to use the eks.privileged PodSecurityPolicy. apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRole metadata: labels: eks.amazonaws.com/component: pod-security-policy kubernetes.io/cluster-service: \"true\" name: eks:podsecuritypolicy:privileged rules: - apiGroups: - policy resourceNames: - eks.privileged resources: - podsecuritypolicies verbs: - use As a best practice we recommend that you scope the binding for privileged pods to service accounts within a particular namespace, e.g. kube-system, and limiting access to that namespace. For all other serviceaccounts/namespaces, we recommend implementing a more restrictive policy such as this: apiVersion: policy/v1beta1 kind: PodSecurityPolicy metadata: name: restricted annotations: seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: 'docker/default,runtime/default' apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: 'runtime/default' seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: 'runtime/default' apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: 'runtime/default' spec: privileged: false # Required to prevent escalations to root. allowPrivilegeEscalation: false # This is redundant with non-root + disallow privilege escalation, # but we can provide it for defense in depth. requiredDropCapabilities: - ALL # Allow core volume types. volumes: - 'configMap' - 'emptyDir' - 'projected' - 'secret' - 'downwardAPI' # Assume that persistentVolumes set up by the cluster admin are safe to use. - 'persistentVolumeClaim' hostNetwork: false hostIPC: false hostPID: false runAsUser: # Require the container to run without root privileges. rule: 'MustRunAsNonRoot' seLinux: # This policy assumes the nodes are using AppArmor rather than SELinux. rule: 'RunAsAny' supplementalGroups: rule: 'MustRunAs' ranges: # Forbid adding the root group. - min: 1 max: 65535 fsGroup: rule: 'MustRunAs' ranges: # Forbid adding the root group. - min: 1 max: 65535 readOnlyRootFilesystem: false This policy prevents pods from running as privileged or escalating privileges. It also restricts the types of volumes that can be mounted and the root supplemental groups that can be added. Attention Fargate is a launch type that enables you to run \"serverless\" container(s) where the containers of a pod are run on infrastructure that AWS manages. With Fargate, you cannot run a privileged container or configure your pod to use hostNetwork or hostPort. Do not run processes in containers as root \u00b6 All containers run as root by default. This could be problematic if an attacker is able to exploit a vulnerability in the application and get shell access to the running container. You can mitigate this risk a variety of ways. First, by removing the shell from the container image. Second, adding the USER directive to your Dockerfile or running the containers in the pod as a non-root user. The Kubernetes podSpec includes a set of fields under spec.securityContext , that allow to let you specify the user and/or group to run your application as. These fields are runAsUser and runAsGroup respectively. You can mandate the use of these fields by creating a pod security policy. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#users-and-groups for further information on this topic. Never run Docker in Docker or mount the socket in the container \u00b6 While this conveniently lets you to build/run images in Docker containers, you're basically reliquishing complete control of the node to the process running in the container. If you need to build container images on Kubernetes use Kaniko , buildah , img , or a build service like CodeBuild instead. Restrict the use of hostPath or if hostPath is necessary restrict which prefixes can be used and configure the volume as read-only \u00b6 hostPath is a volume that mounts a directory from the host directly to the container. Rarely will pods need this type of access, but if they do, you need to be aware of the risks. By default pods that run as root will have write access to the file system exposed by hostPath. This could allow an attacker to modify the kubelet settings, create symbolic links to directories or files not directly exposed by the hostPath, e.g. /etc/shadow, install ssh keys, read secrets mounted to the host, and other malicious things. To mitigate the risks from hostPath, configure the spec.containers.volumeMounts as readOnly , for example: volumeMounts: - name: hostPath-volume readOnly: true mountPath: /host-path You should also use a pod security policy to restrict the directories that can be used by hostPath volumes. For example the following PSP excerpt only allows paths that begin with /foo . It will prevent containers from traversing the host file system from outside the prefix: allowedHostPaths: # This allows \"/foo\", \"/foo/\", \"/foo/bar\" etc., but # disallows \"/fool\", \"/etc/foo\" etc. # \"/foo/../\" is never valid. - pathPrefix: \"/foo\" readOnly: true # only allow read-only mounts Set requests and limits for each container to avoid resource contention and DoS attacks \u00b6 A pod without requests or limits can theoretically consume all of the resources available on a host. As additional pods are scheduled onto a node, the node may experience CPU or memory pressure which can cause the Kubelet to terminate or evict pods from the node. While you can\u2019t prevent this from happening all together, setting requests and limits will help minimize resource contention and mitigate the risk from poorly written applications that consume an excessive amount of resources. The podSpec allows you to specify requests and limits for CPU and memory. CPU is considered a compressible resource because it can be oversubscribed. Memory is incompressible, i.e. it cannot be shared among multiple containers. When you specify requests for CPU or memory, you\u2019re essentially designating the amount of memory that containers are guaranteed to get. Kubernetes aggregates the requests of all the containers in a pod to determine which node to schedule the pod onto. If a container exceeds the requested amount of memory it may be subject to termination if there\u2019s memory pressure on the node. Limits are the maximum amount of CPU and memory resources that a container is allowed to consume and directly corresponds to the memory.limit_in_bytes value of the cgroup created for the container. A container that exceeds the memory limit will be OOM killed. If a container exceeds its CPU limit, it will be throttled. Kubernetes uses 3 Quality of Service (QoS) classes to prioritize the workloads running on a node. These include: guaranteed, burstable, and best effort. If limits and requests are not set, the pod is configured as burstable (lowest priority). Burstable pods are the first to get killed when there is insufficient memory. If limits are set on all containers within the pod, or if the requests and limits are set to the same values, the pod is configured as guaranteed (higheest priority). Guaranteed pods will not be killed unless they exceed their configured memory limits. If the limits and requests are configured with different values, or 1 container within the pod sets limits and the other don\u2019t or have limits set for different resources, the pods are configured as burstable (medium priority). These pods have some resource guarantees, but can be killed once they exceed their requested memory. Be aware that requests doesn\u2019t actually affect the memory_limit_in_bytes value of the cgroup; the cgroup limit is set to the amount of memory available on the host. Nevertheless, setting the requests value too low could cause the pod to be targeted for termination by the kubelet if the node undergoes memory pressure. For additional information about resource QoS, please refer to the Kubernetes documentation You can force the use of requests and limits by setting a resource quota on a namespace or by creating a limit range . A resource quota allows you to specify the total amount of resources, e.g. CPU and RAM, allocated to a namespace. When it\u2019s applied to a namespace, it forces you to specify requests and limits for all containers deployed into that namespace. By contrast, limit ranges give you more granular control of the allocation of resources. With limit ranges you can min/max for CPU and memory resources per pod or per container within a namespace. You can also use them to set default request/limit values if none are provided. Do not allow privileged escalation \u00b6 Privileged escalation allows a process to change the security context under which its running. Sudo is a good example of this as are binaries with the SUID or SGID bit. Privileged escalation is basically a way for users to execute a file with the permissions of another user or group. You can prevent a container from privileged escalation by implementing a pod security policy that sets allowPriviledgedEscalation to false or by setting securityContext.allowPrivilegedEscalation in the podSpec .

The binding shown below is what binds the ClusterRole eks:podsecuritypolicy:privileged to the system:authenticated RBAC group. apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: annotations: kubernetes.io/description: Allow all authenticated users to create privileged labels: eks.amazonaws.com/component: pod-security-policy kubernetes.io/cluster-service: \"true\" name: eks:podsecuritypolicy:authenticated roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: ClusterRole name: eks:podsecuritypolicy:privileged subjects: - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Group name: system:authenticated Lastly, the ClusterRole below allow all bindings that reference it to use the eks.privileged PodSecurityPolicy. apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRole metadata: labels: eks.amazonaws.com/component: pod-security-policy kubernetes.io/cluster-service: \"true\" name: eks:podsecuritypolicy:privileged rules: - apiGroups: - policy resourceNames: - eks.privileged resources: - podsecuritypolicies verbs: - use As a best practice we recommend that you scope the binding for privileged pods to service accounts within a particular namespace, e.g. kube-system, and limiting access to that namespace. For all other serviceaccounts/namespaces, we recommend implementing a more restrictive policy such as this: apiVersion: policy/v1beta1 kind: PodSecurityPolicy metadata: name: restricted annotations: seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: 'docker/default,runtime/default' apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: 'runtime/default' seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: 'runtime/default' apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: 'runtime/default' spec: privileged: false # Required to prevent escalations to root. allowPrivilegeEscalation: false # This is redundant with non-root + disallow privilege escalation, # but we can provide it for defense in depth. requiredDropCapabilities: - ALL # Allow core volume types. volumes: - 'configMap' - 'emptyDir' - 'projected' - 'secret' - 'downwardAPI' # Assume that persistentVolumes set up by the cluster admin are safe to use. - 'persistentVolumeClaim' hostNetwork: false hostIPC: false hostPID: false runAsUser: # Require the container to run without root privileges. rule: 'MustRunAsNonRoot' seLinux: # This policy assumes the nodes are using AppArmor rather than SELinux. rule: 'RunAsAny' supplementalGroups: rule: 'MustRunAs' ranges: # Forbid adding the root group. - min: 1 max: 65535 fsGroup: rule: 'MustRunAs' ranges: # Forbid adding the root group. - min: 1 max: 65535 readOnlyRootFilesystem: false This policy prevents pods from running as privileged or escalating privileges. It also restricts the types of volumes that can be mounted and the root supplemental groups that can be added. Attention Fargate is a launch type that enables you to run \"serverless\" container(s) where the containers of a pod are run on infrastructure that AWS manages. With Fargate, you cannot run a privileged container or configure your pod to use hostNetwork or hostPort.","title":"Restrict the containers that can run as privileged"},{"location":"pods/#do-not-run-processes-in-containers-as-root","text":"All containers run as root by default.

First, by removing the shell from the container image. Second, adding the USER directive to your Dockerfile or running the containers in the pod as a non-root user. The Kubernetes podSpec includes a set of fields under spec.securityContext , that allow to let you specify the user and/or group to run your application as.

To mitigate the risks from hostPath, configure the spec.containers.volumeMounts as readOnly , for example: volumeMounts: - name: hostPath-volume readOnly: true mountPath: /host-path You should also use a pod security policy to restrict the directories that can be used by hostPath volumes.

It will prevent containers from traversing the host file system from outside the prefix: allowedHostPaths: # This allows \"/foo\", \"/foo/\", \"/foo/bar\" etc., but # disallows \"/fool\", \"/etc/foo\" etc. # \"/foo/../\" is never valid. - pathPrefix: \"/foo\" readOnly: true # only allow read-only mounts","title":"Restrict the use of hostPath or if hostPath is necessary restrict which prefixes can be used and configure the volume as read-only"},{"location":"pods/#set-requests-and-limits-for-each-container-to-avoid-resource-contention-and-dos-attacks","text":"A pod without requests or limits can theoretically consume all of the resources available on a host. As additional pods are scheduled onto a node, the node may experience CPU or memory pressure which can cause the Kubelet to terminate or evict pods from the node. While you can\u2019t prevent this from happening all together, setting requests and limits will help minimize resource contention and mitigate the risk from poorly written applications that consume an excessive amount of resources. The podSpec allows you to specify requests and limits for CPU and memory. CPU is considered a compressible resource because it can be oversubscribed. Memory is incompressible, i.e. it cannot be shared among multiple containers. When you specify requests for CPU or memory, you\u2019re essentially designating the amount of memory that containers are guaranteed to get. Kubernetes aggregates the requests of all the containers in a pod to determine which node to schedule the pod onto. If a container exceeds the requested amount of memory it may be subject to termination if there\u2019s memory pressure on the node. Limits are the maximum amount of CPU and memory resources that a container is allowed to consume and directly corresponds to the memory.limit_in_bytes value of the cgroup created for the container. A container that exceeds the memory limit will be OOM killed. If a container exceeds its CPU limit, it will be throttled. Kubernetes uses 3 Quality of Service (QoS) classes to prioritize the workloads running on a node. These include: guaranteed, burstable, and best effort. If limits and requests are not set, the pod is configured as burstable (lowest priority). Burstable pods are the first to get killed when there is insufficient memory. If limits are set on all containers within the pod, or if the requests and limits are set to the same values, the pod is configured as guaranteed (higheest priority). Guaranteed pods will not be killed unless they exceed their configured memory limits. If the limits and requests are configured with different values, or 1 container within the pod sets limits and the other don\u2019t or have limits set for different resources, the pods are configured as burstable (medium priority). These pods have some resource guarantees, but can be killed once they exceed their requested memory. Be aware that requests doesn\u2019t actually affect the memory_limit_in_bytes value of the cgroup; the cgroup limit is set to the amount of memory available on the host. Nevertheless, setting the requests value too low could cause the pod to be targeted for termination by the kubelet if the node undergoes memory pressure. For additional information about resource QoS, please refer to the Kubernetes documentation You can force the use of requests and limits by setting a resource quota on a namespace or by creating a limit range . A resource quota allows you to specify the total amount of resources, e.g. CPU and RAM, allocated to a namespace. When it\u2019s applied to a namespace, it forces you to specify requests and limits for all containers deployed into that namespace. By contrast, limit ranges give you more granular control of the allocation of resources. With limit ranges you can min/max for CPU and memory resources per pod or per container within a namespace. You can also use them to set default request/limit values if none are provided.","title":"Set requests and limits for each container to avoid resource contention and DoS attacks"},{"location":"pods/#do-not-allow-privileged-escalation","text":"Privileged escalation allows a process to change the security context under which its running.

The idea is to detect and/or prevent malicious activity from occuring inside the container. With secure computing (seccomp) you can prevent a containerized application from making certain syscalls to the underlying host operating system's kernel. While the Linux operating system has a few hundred system calls, the lion's share of them are not necessary for running containers. By restricting what syscalls can be made by a container, you can effectively decrease your application's attack surface. To get started with seccomp, analyze the results of a stack trace to see which calls your application is making or use a tool such as syscall2seccomp . Unlike SELinux, seccomp was not designed to isolate containers from each other, however, it will protect the host kernel from unauthorized syscalls. It works by intercepting syscalls and only allowing those that have been whitelisted to pass through. Docker has a default seccomp profile which is suitable for a majority of general purpose workloads. You can also create own profiles for things that require additional privileges. Caution seccomp profiles are a Kubelet alpha feature. You'll need to add the --seccomp-profile-root flag to the Kubelet arguments to make use of this feature. AppArmor is similar to seccomp, only it restricts an container's capabilities including accessing parts of the file system. It can be run in either enforcement or complain mode. Since building Apparmor profiles can be challenging, it is recommended you use a tool like bane instead. Attention Apparmor is only available Ubuntu/Debian distributions of Linux. Attention Kubernetes does not currently provide any native mechanisms for loading AppArmor or seccomp profiles onto Nodes.
